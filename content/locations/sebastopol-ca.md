Sebastopol, CA

Sebastopol, in Northern California, is the ancestral home of Green-Roof-Solar.com. The sun shines and the liberals prevail, all year long. We are so liberal that "green" is just a symbolic way-station on the path to nirvana. If Sebastopol had our way, we'd have a Tesla in every carport, at least one solar roof per capita, and another on the barn.

My chicken coop has a solar roof! That should give you some idea...

125 S. Main St. #127, Sebastopol, CA 95472
