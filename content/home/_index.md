Green-Roof-Solar is your Premier Solar installation and roofing company in Sonoma County. We (GRS) are proud to be part of a movement that is dedicated to making Sonoma County 100% renewable by 2030. We are blessed to have almost year round sunshine and a political climate conducive to clean energy alternatives. There are still hefty rebates from California and the Federal Government that make going Solar very attractive.

Join the Solar Revolution. All the major car manufacturers are selling, or planning to sell, all electric and/or partial electric vehicles as we speak. Tesla is leading the charge, so to speak, in Lithium-Ion battery technologies which will bring down the price of electric vehicles dramatically. The batteries are still the biggest cost barrier, but that is changing. Tesla's Giga-Factories are churning out Lithium Ion cells for use in many types of batteries, including car batteries and home based systems designed to save the energy of a roof-top solar array for use at night or through cloudy periods. 

The most popular solar roof installation is one that hooks into the main power grid and either reduces or eliminates your electrical bill. Some hardier systems can be installed, and connected, to the grid that make money!

But, for customers of Green Roof Solar in Sebastopol, Petaluma and Santa Rosa, California, one of the biggest benefits of solar installation is getting off the grid and contributing to the well being of Planet Earth. It is possible to create enough electricity from your roof to power all your household electrical needs AND power an electric vehicle or two.

Imagine driving in a car that is powered from the sun! Imagine never going to the gas station again! It is possible. Call Green Roof Solar today.
