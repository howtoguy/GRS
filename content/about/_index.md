description: "A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Sonoma County, I decided that Solar was the way to go. We can't keep burning fossil fuels, for a number of reasons, forever. We need to generate our own clean, grean energy and we need to do it now! Of all the roofs in the World, mine points South and generates enough energy, and more, to power my car: â€”G.Magnamous."

<p style="text-align:left">_About Green Roof Solar_ GSR Started thinking about Solar in 1959 when Edward Teller (the father of the atom bomb) warned the World about greenhouse gases. He said that the CO2 released from combustion of fossil fuels would heat up the environment, raise the sea levels, and create disturbing and distructive weather patterns. We are seeing that today. There are a number of Climate Deniers, but they are mostly aligned with the fossil fuel industry, influenced by the fossil fuel industry, or housed in Northern countries (like Russia) that may actually gain financially (in the short term) by the melting of the polar caps so that they can capitalize on the now accessible drilling opportunities beneath the melting ice. It's a very cynical game. Polar bears will perish. Island communities in the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia will be inundated and need refugee assistancc, or they will perish. The distrubution of water and food will be complicated. Scores will die. And for what? So that Russia and Northern China and Big Oil executives can profit financially? No thank you.

It might be too late, some Scientists think so, but I am eternally optimistic about the Human spirit to survive, prosper, and do what's right in the ugly face of Conservative blindness.

We have to think big and we have to act small. Each of us.

I want to be energy independent. I want to suck as much energy out of the Sun as possible. ALL the energy on this planet was created by the Sun. Let me repteat that. Every bit of energy on this planet was, and is, created by our Sun. The Sun is a huge fireball of Fusion energy easily capeable of powering ALL of Earths energy needs.

Do a little. Get an electric car. Get a Solar Roof. Power all your needs with the Sun. Power your life with Solar.</p>
